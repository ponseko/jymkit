"""Input/output coverage for the algorithm networks.

These obs/action spaces cover the paths we want supported in terms of possible
input/output networks and multi-agent support. Each one is handed to
`check_env`, the same function every registry environment goes through, so a
space is tested here exactly the way a real environment is tested elsewhere.

`check_env` is structural: it asserts what gets built and what shape comes out,
abstractly, without compiling. What it cannot see is *values* -- a mask applied to
the wrong axis with a coincidentally valid shape. `TestActionMasking` below covers
that with real compiled execution on deliberately restrictive masks, and is the only
part of this file that runs anything.
